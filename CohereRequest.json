I was working on a pipeline for text preprocessing before sending to NLU system to comprehend the message and frame it as question that captures the intent removing not necessary info. I tried to look at how verbosity could be captured, there were resources on finding the independent clause, number of tokens and arrive at a verbosity score. This is just to know when a text needs simplification in the pipeline"
