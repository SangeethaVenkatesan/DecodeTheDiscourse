# Decode the Discourse

**Problem Scope**: The issue at hand is the need for active participation and engagement in conversations on LinkedIn, particularly for students who seek to connect with others and foster social interaction. To achieve this, it is important to generate a variety of responses and improve the conversational experience by enhancing context memory, grouping conversations, and analyzing cognitive aspects. With the aid of conversational AI, recommendations for responses can be provided to further enhance engagement. This project aims to create a dashboard using Elixir that aggregates conversation data, identifies key topics discussed, and provides intelligent feedback to individuals seeking to improve their conversational skills. Overall, engaging in conversations on LinkedIn is an effective means of connecting with professionals in one's field.

Note: Its not a tool for actively replacing the human conversation input, ultimately I would love to incorporate RLHF with Linkedin user who would like to craft the response to include a bit of their persona in the conversations. 






SETUP:

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
  * Create a dev.secret.exs and add config :linkedin_response, :COHERE_API_KEY, "" - this will help to load the key in the application.


Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
